# SimpleIRCLib for Csharp
**THIS LIBRARY IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT**
**STARTING AT V2.0.0 THIS LIBRARY IS NOT BACK-WARDS COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS!**

This library is designed to make communication through IRC easier to implement in your application. In comparison to other C# IRC libraries, this library also enables you to download using the DCC (XDCC) protocol, used by IRC. 

It's main features are:

  - Is simple to use.
  - Is simple to implement
  - It's lightweight

-New v2.0.0 and up tutorial comming soon!

### Development
I will try to fix (significant) bugs as quick as possible, but due to my study taking a rollercoaster dive in a few days it might take a while before an actual update will appear. It is very barebone and does need some refinement. So, progress in development will come down to how much free time I have and how much of it I want to spend working on this library.

### Todos

- Some DCC fixes, most things seem to work, but there are some odd cases where it might not work.
- More readable code (getting better)
- Renaming some stupidly named names 


### Disclaimer
This library is still in alpha stadium, many things might go wrong and therefore I am not 
responsible for whatever happens while you use this application.
